## Toy Robot

# Installation
1. Download this git repo
2. Go to src/ folder and open robot.html on your browser
3. You should see the robot app

# Configuration
1. Open src/robot.html on a text editor or IDE
2. Go to the script section (near the bottom of file)
3. Update config json as needed

# Caveats/To Do Items
1. add code validation. no code validation done for (some) input and robot status. depends on form object 'disabled' attribute
2. perhaps refactor this to be reusable plugin? for multi-instance, etc
3. accessibility not set
4. no unit testing (no UI framework)
5. not tested on mobile, other browsers (only Chrome)

# Misc
1. added keyboard shortcuts (left & right arrows [rotate], spacebar [move])
